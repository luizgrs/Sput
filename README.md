Helper for enable Speech Recognition in HTML Inputs using Web Speech API


x-webkit-speech Deprecation
============================

Once the attribute x-webkit-speech is deprecated there is no easy way to enable speech recognition in input fields. 

The attribute used not only SpeechRecognition but also Web Audio API in order to provide a feedback for the audio input

Sput will enable a very similar behavior like the old x-webkit-speech attribute.
